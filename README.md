# dynamicQuery

I want to choose my axes for research from one to 4, first of all the user choose his first axe
(the name of a colonne in my data frame from a selectinput: firstAxe),
the results will be displayed in selectinput(firstAxeOutput) after that he can choose the second axe (selectinput: secondAxe),
he can choose results from the first axe output or not and he will continue that until the end of axes.

i do that with a dynamic query but the problem is that when i choose a value from the output my qyery and my dataframe
sho the right result for juste a while and then come back to old values, i dont know why?
